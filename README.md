<h3 align="center"> Shell for launching android device emulator without opening Android Studio</h3>

## Usage 

Edit the path command inside of .sh file

##### Usually it comes as default like:

```sh
C:/Users/USER_NAME/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/tools
```
After that run it and the list of android devices which you have them installed will pop up as in the screenshot below. Enter the number of the device you want to work with.
